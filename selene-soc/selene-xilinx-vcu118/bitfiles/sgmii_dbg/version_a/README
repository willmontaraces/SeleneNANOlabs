Build selene-xilinx-vcu118_a version 2
* Active high reset going in to SGMII is generated from  rstraw
* Internal to sgmii, all signals are brought to a steady value by making the reset to asynchronous set and sync release
* EDCL init is stopped until kicked. Bug fix included. MDIO is not held frozen by kick bit. Only EDCL state machine is held by kick bit in ctrl register.


Test method
-------------
1. Program the FPGA with the bitfile in this folder
2. Connect to the design using grmon -u -digilent
3. Set unique EDCL IP address and mac ID
	commands :
	edcl 192.168.X.Y  --- unique IP address
	wmem 0xfc084028 value1 -- EDCL MAC MSB
	wmem 0xfc08402c value2 -- EDCL MAC LSB
			       -- With MSB+LSB EDCL should have a qunique MAC address 
4. source eth_test.tcl that is placed in this folder. This will configure the PHY and kick the edcl well after that.
5. Try connecting using EDCL
	commands :
	grmon -u -eth 192.168.X.Y
