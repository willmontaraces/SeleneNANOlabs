Build selene-xilinx-vcu118 non-gpl version with sgmii external reset
* Active high reset going in to SGMII is taken in from an external switch- Switch number 3 of SW12 switch set on the vcu118 board
* Internal to sgmii, all signals are brought to a steady value by making the reset to asynchronous set and sync release


Test method
-------------
1. Program the FPGA with the bitfile in this folder
2. Connect to the deisgn using grmon -u -digilent
3. Set unique EDCL IP address and mac ID
	commands :
	edcl 192.168.X.Y  --- unique IP address
	wmem 0xfc084028 value1 -- EDCL MAC MSB
	wmem 0xfc08402c value2 -- EDCL MAC LSB
			       -- With MSB+LSB EDCL should have a qunique MAC address 
4. source eth_test.tcl that is placed in this folder
5. Change switch 3 of SW12 switch set on the vcu118 board, from 0 to 1(towards ON position) and wait for few seconds(This will reset the SGMII IP)
6. Change back the switch 3 of SW12 switch set on the vcu118 board, from 1 to 0(This will de-assert the active high reset to sgmii IP)
7. Exit from grmon connection.
8. Try connecting using EDCL
	commands :
	grmon -u -eth 192.168.X.Y
