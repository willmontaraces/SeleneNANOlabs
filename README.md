# selene-hardware
This repository holds the SELENE hardware platform.

Remember to clone this repository recursively, as interconnect/axi and interconnect/common\_cells are submodules.
To simulate the SoC and/or generate the SELENE plaftorm for the VCU118 follow the instructions at **selene-soc/selene-xilinx-vcu118/README.txt**

The directories are organized as follows:

| Path | Description |
| ------ | ----------| 
|grlib | GRLIB IP core library |
|grlib/bin | GRLIB infrastructure |
|grlib/boards | Board description files |
|grlib/designs | Template designs |
|grlib/doc | GRLIB documentation |
|grlib/lib | GRLIB IP core RTL code |
|grlib/software | NOEL-V example software |
|selene-soc | SELENE SoC directory |
|selene-soc/rtl | Design files common to all FPGAs |
|selene-soc/selene-generic | Generic template design |
|selene-soc/selene-xilinx-vcu118 | Template design tailored for VCU118 |
|accelerators | Colection of tested HLS generated IP cores |
|safety | Safety related IP cores |
|interconnect | Interconnect submodules and bridging logic |
